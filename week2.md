## Introduction
This week I will improve my design. When this is done I will break it down to small parts to improve them one by one.

## Concept
Tetris puzzle layout, blocks will fall up when you scroll.
Information about the concept can be found at [week 1, concept 3: puzzle](https://github.com/maybuzz/css-to-the-rescue-1819/blob/master/week1.md).
