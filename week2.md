## Introduction
This week I will improve my design. I will have to finish my layout (desktop, tablet and mobile) before I start adding animations, transitions and weather toggles. When this is done I want to add illustrations.

## Concept
Tetris puzzle layout, using position sticky. Blocks will "fall" up when you scroll.
Information about the concept can be found at [week 1, concept 3: puzzle](https://github.com/maybuzz/css-to-the-rescue-1819/blob/master/week1.md).
