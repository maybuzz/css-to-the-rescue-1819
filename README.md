## Introduction
For this assignment I chose to create a responsive restaurant menu, using several restrictions. I'm going to work with BEM syntax. [Click here](#Assignment) for more information about the assignment.

## Assignment
Create a responsive restaurant menu using only **two colours** (restriction 1) and a **design that responds to weather** (restriction 2). I'm going to write my CSS using the **BEM** methodology.  

## Process
At the beginning I focussed to much on getting a solid concept. I started working on different layouts a started working from there.
I improved my `css grid` skills by working with `grid-areas`. I started working with `position: sticky`.

## Concept
My Tetris-puzzle-menu is an iteration on my bars-menu concept.
More information about my concepts can be found [here](https://github.com/maybuzz/css-to-the-rescue-1819/blob/master/week1.md).
