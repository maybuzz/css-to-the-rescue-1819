## Assignment
Create a responsive restaurant menu using only **two colours** (restriction 1) and a **design that responds to weather** (restriction 2). I'm going to write my CSS using the **BEM** methodology.   

## Concept
My Tetris-puzzle-menu is an iteration on my bars-menu concept.
More information about my concepts can be found [here](https://github.com/maybuzz/css-to-the-rescue-1819/blob/master/week1.md) in `week 1`.

## Features
- `position: sticky` -> works fine in chrome and firefox. Safari is lacking. Position sticky needs a bit of attention, but it's really fun to work with. I wish I challenged myself to go to the extreme and do the *impossible*.

- `grid-template-areas: ...` -> this was not the first time I worked with display: grid, but I never used grid-area before. This really helped me out this project. Creating different layouts was very easy.

- `animation`, `transition` & `transform` -> I never really invested time to animate of transform things. I never really understood how and couldn't come up with good ideas. This was my main goal; to learn how to add animations the right way.

- `simple design` -> last but not least, I wanted to create a nice product using simple design. The two colors restriction really helped with that. I think I really succeeded in this.
