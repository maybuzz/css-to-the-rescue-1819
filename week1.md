## Assignment
Create a responsive restaurant menu using only **two colours** (restriction 1) and a **design that responds to weather** (restriction 2). I'm going to write my CSS using the **BEM** methodology.  

## Concepts
### Concept 1: Illustrations
![Illustrations concept](/src/img/concept-illustrations.png)   
At first I wanted to add **illustrations** and combine them **with animations**. The idea was to scroll trough the menu and scroll the dishes on to the plate. I still think this is a cool idea, but it will be a bit hard to make cool illustrations using only 2 colours trough the website.

### Concept 2: Bars
![Bars concept](/src/img/concept-bars.png)   
For my second concept I wanted to keep it simple. I wanted to play with **simple designs**, use of two colours **and animations**. For this design I chose to use bars. Vertical bars for desktop that open when you hover over them. Smaller screens will have 2 or 3 blocks that will open horizontally when you click on them.

I like this idea, but I'm missing some depth. It doesn't feel "cool" enough... Moving on!

### Concept 3: Puzzle

This last concept will combine some of the previous ideas. I still want a simple design and a lot of css animations, but I'm going to add some scrolling-action. I want to start of with a simple menu design using blocks. These blocks will form the "puzzle". Scrolling through the page will make each block come forward while the others disappear. The dishes will fly through the page depending on the weather.

A **calm summer breeze** will make the elements fly through the page at a low pace. I'd like some bird sounds in the background and use two light colours.

A **rainy day** will have two different (darker) colours and some other animations. For example, elements will float up and down as if they're falling down. Hovering over them will make them stop.

A **cloudy day** will, again, have two different colours. I think it would be fun to have something represent clouds. Users will have to 'blow' the clouds away so they can read the dishes.
