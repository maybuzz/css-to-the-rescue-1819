## Assignment
Create a responsive restaurant menu using only **two colours** (restriction 1) and a **design that responds to weather** (restriction 2). I'm going to write my CSS using the **BEM** methodology.  

## Concepts
### Concept 1: Illustrations
![Illustrations concept](/src/img/concept-illustrations.png)   
At first I wanted to add **illustrations** and combine them **with animations**. The idea was to scroll trough the menu and scroll the dishes on to the plate. I still think this is a cool idea, but it will be a bit hard to make cool illustrations using only 2 colours trough the website.

### Concept 2: Bars
![Bars concept](/src/img/concept-bars.png)   
For my second concept I wanted to keep it simple. I wanted to play with **simple designs**, use of two colours **and animations**. For this design I chose to use bars. Vertical bars for desktop that open when you hover over them. Smaller screens will have 2 or 3 blocks that will open horizontally when you click on them.

I like this idea, but I'm missing some depth. It doesn't feel "cool" enough... Moving on!

### Concept 3: Puzzle

This last concept will combine some of the previous ideas. I still want a simple design and a lot of css animations, but I'm going to add some scrolling-action. I want to start with a simple menu design using blocks. These blocks will form the "puzzle", kind of like the game "Tetris". Scrolling through the page will make each block come forward and stick to the top of the page.

The colours of the page will change depending on the weather. On a **hot summer day** the page will be light. On a **rainy day** the page will be darker. On a **cloudy day** the page will look blurry and grey. Hover will clear up the blur effect.

Eventually I'd like to add animations and transitions to show the change of the weather.
